### Cat-Dog Classification using Pytorch

This is a common computer vision project to classifier images whether it is cat or dog. While the output is the accuracy, the main objective of this project is not to get a high accuracy but rather to learn how to use convolution neural network (CNN) for classification using Pytorch.

### Data
The data can be downloaded in the kaggle website using this link https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog. Please make sure to extract this and save it in a folder called Data.


### Usage

To execute the project, you only need to run the file below in your terminal

```
python3 main.py
```

### Results

Following are the observed results.
